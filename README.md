# COMP 4300 Final Project:

By Jacob Diaz, for COMP 4300 (Networking) at the University of Manitoba, 2022.

### Topic:

Creating an IoT device that can perform data measurements and work seamlessly over the user's local network. This device is paired with an Android application that allows the user to execute commands as well as take live and background readings.

The purpose of this device is to solve practical problems regarding ambient conditions like temperature, humidity, and UV light affecting a 3D printer's ability to create object properly

This project is summarized and guided within **Report.docx**, please read it to get the full project explanation!

### Tools:

The tools/libs used in this project are:
* [*PyCharm IDE*](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) - for [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/) Raspberry Pi Pico W development.
* [*Unity 2021*](https://unity.com/releases/2021-lts) - for Android C# development
* [*Newtonsoft.JSON*](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json) - for C# JSON serialization
* [*Shapes*](https://acegikmo.com/shapes/) - A vector graphic library used to improve the look of the mobile app.
